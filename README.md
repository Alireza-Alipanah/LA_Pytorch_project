# LA_Pytorch_project

This project consists of two parts:</br>
<ol>
<li>
Simple implementation of PCA algorithm on Iris dataset to be able to show the dataset on a 2D figure.
</li>
<li>
Simple recommender system to be able to give movie suggestions based on user's rating for other movies. We utilize SVD here to be able to guess the unkown ratings.
